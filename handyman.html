      <h1>Find Your Next Handyman</h1>

      <p>
        This concept project focuses on helping people quickly find reliable handymen for small jobs,
        repairs, and maintenance around the home or workplace.
      </p>

      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Many people do not know who to call for small tasks such as fixing a minor issue,
        assembling furniture, or carrying out basic repairs. They often rely on word of mouth,
        long online searches, or trial and error.
      </p>

      <h2>The Concept</h2>
      <p>
        The idea is to provide a simple, trusted place where people can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Choose the type of job they need help with</li>
        <li>Browse a small list of reliable handymen in their area</li>
        <li>Send a quick request with basic details of the job</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Planned Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Categories for work such as repairs, maintenance, and furniture assembly</li>
        <li>Short profiles for each handyman with location and services</li>
        <li>A simple enquiry form to request contact or a quote</li>
        <li>Potential for ratings or feedback in the future</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        As my web development skills grow, this could become a small working demo for a
        handyman-matching service.
